      <h2> Answer to Questions </h2>
      <p>
       <strong>Q2:</strong> After looking at my website on Chrome, Edge, and Safari, I saw that for the most part, they all looked the same. The elements of the site looked pretty consistent across each browser.
       <br>
       <strong>Q3:</strong> Before I made any code changes, clicking on the text did not put the field into "focus." This matters because users may intuitively think that clicking on the text should select that option. Therefore, to make my site more user-friendly, I would want to modify the code so that clicking on the text will select that option.
       <br>
       <strong>Q7:</strong> After hosting my code and running it through the validator, there were no new issues that rose.
