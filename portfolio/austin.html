        <h2>Austin Tenants' Council Website Revamp</h2>
        <p>As part of the Knowbility OpenAir Competition, I helped to recreate the website for Austin Tenants' Council, a non-profit that protects tenants' rights in Travis County, Texas and educates the community on fair housing. My team and I created a completely new website and worked with ATC to organize their information and implement accessibility features on the site.</p>

  <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="flex-item a">
        <p>The current Austin Tenants' Council site is lacking in appeal and have little to no accessibility features. The content on the site is disorganized and difficult for any visitor to parse through. Furthermore, the management at ATC has a very difficult time updating the site with new information and must rely on a single IT worker to make the changes. They wanted to create a new site that they could easily manage with a content management system and was appealing and informative to visitors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item b "><h2>The Problem</h2></div>
    <div class="flex-item c"><h2>The Solution</h2></div>
    <div class="flex-item d">
      <p>Because they requested a content management system, my team and I chose to use SquareSpace as the basis for the site and added on customized HTML and CSS ourselves. To organize and manage the content, we worked with ATC management to pick out the important information and group them into more meaningful and intuitive sections. We then sectioned the site so that visitors could easily navigate to the section that they needed. Lastly, we added some accessibility features to make their site more accessible to users. Check out the new site below!</p></div>
